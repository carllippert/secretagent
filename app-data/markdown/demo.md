mentinoed "Bacalauh is good for ai projects?"

p2p comsumar apps category:

"Best use of Helia, Kubo or other IPFS"
5k split between 5 teams = $1k

Lit actions for group access to encrypted github stuff yes?
DataOS
polybase is web3 suapbase?

Filecoin Data Tools "Suit"
$5k for 5 teams - $1k

Lighthouse SDK $2500 sdk

"Timelock encryption" via drand

Most important things

- [ ] react-flow + [[Tauri]]
- [ ] save react-flow to [[IPFS]]
- [ ] talk to model via [[libp2p]]

look into how dendron does it. they are a vscode plugin

tauri looking liike an option for ipfs local

but they opted for wails

polybase could be the queue?

Might use [[FlowWise]] vs [[Langflow]] because its a fully js implementation

```txt
This project is using what I'm calling theÂ **"PRRTT"**Â stack (Prisma, Rust, React, TypeScript, Tauri).

- Prisma on the front-end?Â ðŸ¤¯Â Made possible thanks toÂ [prisma-client-rust](https://github.com/brendonovich/prisma-client-rust), developed byÂ [Brendonovich](https://github.com/brendonovich). Gives us access to the powerful migration CLI in development, along with the Prisma syntax for our schema. The application bundles with the Prisma query engine and codegen for a beautiful Rust API. Our lightweight migration runner is custom built for a desktop app context.
- Tauri allows us to create a pure Rust native OS webview, without the overhead of your average Electron app. This brings the bundle size and average memory usage down dramatically. It also contributes to a more native feel, especially on macOS due to Safari's close integration with the OS.
- We also useÂ [rspc](https://rspc.dev/)Â which allows us to define functions in Rust and call them on the Typescript frontend in a completely typesafe manner, so no unnecessary bugs make it into production!
- The core (`sdcore`) is written in pure Rust.
```

ChatGPT answer about answer

```txt
In the context you provided, "bundling as a resource" refers to including your dependencies or virtual environment as a resource within your Tauri application. Instead of relying on PyInstaller to extract the bundled files to a temporary directory during runtime, you would package them directly as part of your Tauri application's build.

By bundling your dependencies as a resource, you can avoid the extraction step performed by PyInstaller, which can help speed up the startup time of your application.

To accomplish this, you would typically include the necessary files or directories within your Tauri project and configure Tauri to access them appropriately. This may involve modifying your Tauri configuration (`tauri.conf.json`) and specifying the paths to the bundled files or directories.

For example, if you have a virtual environment containing your Python dependencies, you would include the entire virtual environment directory within your Tauri project and specify its path in the Tauri configuration. Tauri can then access the bundled virtual environment directly without relying on PyInstaller to extract it at runtime.

Note that bundling dependencies as a resource may require additional configuration and setup within your Tauri project. You may need to adjust how your Tauri application initializes or accesses the bundled dependencies to ensure they are used correctly.

It's important to consult the Tauri documentation and consider the specific requirements and recommendations for bundling resources within a Tauri application. The exact steps and configurations may vary depending on your project's setup and needs.

maybe the idea is to store everything in [[NDJSON]]

- [ ] write and save file to ipfs
- [ ] send messages via libp2
- [ ] backup messages via ipfs
- [ ] encrypt everything
- [ ] create everything as a vector taht can be searched
